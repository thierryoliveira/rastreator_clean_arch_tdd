# Rastreator
> An easy app to track your delivery packages.  
>This project was developed just to show some skills and good habits with Flutter, feel free to use or change as you want.  
> On this repository, I pushed the same app in two versions, using different state managers, being them GetX and Bloc.  
> The first version was made using GetX, so I decided to know how hard is decouple this lib from an app, and using a nice pattern like clean architecture and SOLID concepts like dependency inversion, it was **really easy**!


## Review
To this project, I used Clean Architecture and some unit tests following TDD for each layer.

## important worked topics

* Flutter
* Clean Architecture
* Unit Tests
* SOLID
* State management (Bloc and GetX)
* HTTP Requests for a REST API
* Dependency Injection (GetIt and the built-in dependency injection lib of GetX)

    
## Utils

[Bloc lib](https://bloclibrary.dev/)
